# chatgpt-irc-bot
A python (https://pypi.org/project/irc/) IRC bot that relays messages from channels / PMs to ChatGPT.

Made with ChatGPT and some coaxing.
PRs should be ChatGPT transcripts and screenshots :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:



TODO:
1. Use a single function to deal with both `privmsg` and `pubmsg`
2. Improve how it groks text instead of the current monstrosity

BUGS:
1. Poems / limericks composed by ChatGPT are not properly formatted
